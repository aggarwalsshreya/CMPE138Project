This repo contains the sql queries that create the data layer for a movie/TV show application that allows users to retrieve information about movies and TV shows. We used the IMDb database from ‘big-query-public-data’. The queries fetch details such as titles, reviews, release years, genres, directors, episodes, ratings, cast, crew, etc.
